summary: "Disscussion of hero-specific tutorials in hero shooters and MOBAs with Mecha Break as a possitive example"
---



Tutorials in games are important. They help players understand what is required of them and how to achieve it. They help developers avoid overwhelming players with a huge flood of new information.

The most classic scheme is to demonstrate the mechanics → a single-action task using them → a challenge through repeated use or combination with other mechanics. This allows new information to be absorbed very smoothly, first in isolation and then in context.


A good and very popular example is Portal. In it, if you take three levels starting with the introduction of any new mechanic, you can very easily trace the use of this pattern.

However, when we look at modern projects, particularly hero shooters or MOBAs, there are little to no tutorials. Only showing the controls and providing a description of the abilities with a video would be enough to start playing, but each character must be studied independently in real matches.
Not to say that it is bad; there is a certain thrill in discovering possibilities and combinations on your own, but developers can make efforts to improve this. Similar to a good professor, don't give the correct answer right away, but give the direction and tools to discover it.

In Mecha BREAK, which I had been waiting for a long time, the developers made this effort and implemented a general tutorial plus two-stage training for each character.


The first part has [cutscenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fTi_fJzFYE) to give a plot-based motivation for actions, teaches the basics of control and differences from other games, for example, that melee weapons pass through armour. The second part teaches the mechanics of the battle royale mode.

### But the reason for this post is the optional training for each character and the trials.


In the training, we go through the first two stages, ‘story’ and ‘task.’ We are told about the ability, shown what it does, and sometimes how it looks from the enemy's perspective. Then we are given an easy task with no possibility of losing for practice. And so on for each individual ability.


But in the trials, they test how well we have understood all these abilities separately and in combination, in scenarios with strictly limited time and situations that may occur in the game.



1️⃣ So, on **Alysnes**, you will have to train movement in the air above lava to learn energy management or combat two other melee strikers, memorising the timing of parries.

2️⃣ On the sniper **Aquila**, who has high mobility in the air, the tests train hitting flying targets at a distance and surviving the counterattacks of enemy mechs.

3️⃣ On the tank **Tricera**, we are trained to escort cargo against a group of enemies, protect allies from missiles and opponents, and how NOT to use a grenade launcher against a panther (spoiler: don't dump everything into the shield).

In addition to internal motivation to pass tests to learn a new character (or how to counter it), there is also external motivation: an epic title in the player card customisation screen and currency used to unlock new stats to show off.

The only controversial point is the lack of any hints, which can be annoying on particularly difficult challenges due to a lack of understanding. On the other hand, this forces you to think and analyse your arsenal and how to use it in a given situation, providing the feeling of discovery I mentioned earlier.


### How can this be projected onto other games?


That's a good question. I don't think it's worth changing the format too much, and it definitely shouldn't be mandatory. Challenges should be difficult to reflect a real competitive environment and to teach advanced tricks. It won't be easy to come up with challenges, but if the game designers really know their game, I think it is a worthy investment of development time to improve UX. The main problem for most games will be TTK, which is quite high in Mecha BREAK, allowing for more variety in the challenges. Nevertheless, let's imagine some possibilities.


**In Marvel Rivals**, Squirrel Girl might have a challenge like this: use rebounds to execute the rmb-lmb-e-rmb-lmb combo to corner a mobile character and kill them. Or, continuously fire at destructible ultimates to prevent the killing of X allied characters.


**In Siege**, it may be necessary to destroy the boards in the floor to fire on a protected position from above, or to make holes in the walls to simultaneously control 2-3 passages for 1.5 minutes. Or Ash can use a grenade launcher to quickly run from point A to point B.


**In Overwatch**, Tracer must consecutively dodge six grenades/skillshots in a row or teleport between platforms to avoid falling.

PS. I remember that Valve introduced something similar in Dota a few years ago, but I may be mistaken.
PPS. It was introduced in Overwatch, but not for all heroes.
